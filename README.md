# bot_website
To run the bot website, you'll need to follow these steps:

1. Ensure that you have completed all the steps mentioned in the previous responses, including setting up the file structure, creating the necessary HTML templates, CSS, JavaScript, and Python files, and defining the required routes and database operations.

2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the root folder of your bot website project.

3. Make sure you have Python and Flask installed. If you haven't installed Flask, you can do so by running `pip install flask` in the terminal.

4. Once you have Flask installed, run the Flask application by executing the `app.py` file. In the terminal, type the following command:

   ```
   python app.py
   ```

   You should see a message indicating that the Flask server is running and listening on `http://localhost:5000` or a similar address.

5. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000`. You should now see your bot website running, and you can access the various pages like the admin login page, admin dashboard, edit bot information, and delete bot information pages.

6. To access the admin panel, use the admin credentials you defined in the `app.py` file during the login process.

7. Test all the functionalities of your bot website, including adding, editing, and deleting bot information, to ensure everything works as expected.

8. Keep the terminal running as long as you want the website to be accessible. If you want to stop the server, you can press `Ctrl + C` in the terminal to terminate the Flask application.

Remember that the above steps assume you are running the bot website on your local machine for development and testing purposes. For production deployment, you'll need to consider hosting the application on a web server, such as a cloud hosting platform like Heroku or AWS, and use a production-grade database instead of SQLite, among other considerations.

Additionally, for security purposes, ensure you follow best practices for handling user credentials and other sensitive data, and implement appropriate security measures to protect the website from potential attacks.

I hope this helps you run your bot website! If you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask. Happy coding!
